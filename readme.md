# Voadeira - Chrome Extension

A friend expressed a desire to be able to easily switch from one Amazon site to another
(`amazon.com` -> `amazon.co.uk`, for example), while being able to keep looking at the
same product or at least search for that product on the other domain. Amazon lets you
do this by clicking the flag icon at the top, but it's slower and seems to be intended
as a more permanent change.

This extension hopefully makes that a little easier. The user simply selects 2 TLDs
they'd like to be able to switch between, and then on any Amazon site, the button will
enable in the extension popup (top right) and allow them to swap to the other nation's
site to look at the product or search for it.

It is not super reliable, and I'm sure there are many details on Amazon's storefront and
tech stack that I don't know about that might thwart this in different ways. Oh well!
This is what I could do.

This extension is named after [a speedboat used on the Amazon River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voadeira).
