# Voadeira - Chrome Extension

A friend expressed a desire to be able to easily switch from one Amazon site to another (`amazon.co.uk` -> `amazon.com`, for example), while being able to keep looking at the same product or at least search for that product on the other domain.

This extension, named after [a speedboat used on the Amazon River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voadeira), is an attempt at this.
